A WordPress plugin that explores practical, focused solutions and enhancements for WordPress Multisite.

== Description ==

MultiSyde enhances the WordPress Multisite experience by addressing common usability challenges and streamlining network administration tasks. Developed by [Syde](https://profiles.wordpress.org/syde/) as both a practical tool and proof-of-concept for potential WordPress core improvements, with a focus on Multisite. 

The plugin targets WordPress Multisite network administrators, developers, and organizations managing multiple WordPress sites. It focuses on targeted, high-impact enhancements rather than attempting to solve all Multisite challenges at once.

MultiSyde follows a modular architecture where each feature addresses specific pain points identified in [WordPress Trac tickets](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/active/) and community feedback. The plugin is actively developed and welcomes community contributions via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/inpsyde/multisyde/ "MultiSyde GitHub Repository"). See the FAQ for more details on how to contribute.

== Features ==

**Enhanced Site Retrieval** - New `get_site_by()` utility function for easier site lookups by ID, slug, domain, path, or URL (addresses Trac [#40180](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40180/ "WordPress Trac Ticket #40180"))

**Last User Login Tracking** - Adds "Last Login" column to Network Admin Users screen with automatic timestamp recording (addresses MultiSyde GitHub issue [#11](https://github.com/inpsyde/multisyde/issues/11/ "MultiSyde GitHub Issue #11"))

**Site Active Plugins** - See which plugins are active on each site, with bulk deactivation across subsites (addresses Trac [#53255](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/53255/ "WordPress Trac Ticket #53255"))

**Site Active Theme** - Displays the active theme for each site in the Network Admin dashboard, making it easier to manage themes across the network (addresses Trac [#56458](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56458/ "WordPress Trac Ticket #56458"))

**Permalink Cleanup** - Automatically removes the `/blog` prefix from the main site's permalink structure in multisite networks for cleaner URLs (addresses GitHub issue [#24](https://github.com/inpsyde/multisyde/issues/24 "MultiSyde GitHub Issue #24"))

The feature set continues to expand based on community contributions and real-world needs.
